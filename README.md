# TaxiDriverStatsManager
A Small app to keep stats over my daily taxi job

It will track:
- the name of the central wich a taxi is registered
- shifts with all its trips
- maintenance on a taxi
- and track drivers registered in the app.

Datamodels is in a .net standard library so hopefully one day i can mak a online
api, and app to phone and wpf desktop app to windows

This is a project i have started to learn C# watching youtube videos.
